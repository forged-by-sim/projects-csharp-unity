1. Select the two things that a data type tells us below

==> How to interpret the bits for variables of that data type

The data type for a variable tells whether the bits in the memory location for that variable should be interpreted as a whole number, a real number, a character, or a Boolean.

==> Valid operations for variables of that data type

The data type for a variable tells us what operations we can perform with that variable.



Incorrect answers below

==> The address of a variable of that data type

The memory addresses of our variables are determined when we run our program, and luckily, in C# we never have to deal with addresses at all! The compiler uses the data types to make sure we can build our projects, so data types are used before our program even runs.

==> The name of the variable of that data type

When we declare a variable, we provide both the data type and the variable name. Those are two distinct pieces of information, so the data type doesn't tell us the name
