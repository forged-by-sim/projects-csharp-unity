2^b = n 

We need b bits to represent n distinct things. 

The inverse relationship is:

n unique values can be represented using log2n bits

1. You have 4 bits you can use to give unique names (using binary!) to 
different inventory items in your game. How many unique names can you 
have?

==> 16 

Because 2 raised to the power b = n. The b in the equation is the number of bits and the n is the number of unique things we can represent with those bits.  In this case, b is 4, and 2 raised to the power 4 =16, 
so n is 16.



2. You need to represent 31 unique values in binary. How many bits do you need?

==> 5

We can't have "partial bits", and because 4 bits isn't enough and 5 bits can be used to represent 32 unique things, we need to use 5 bits.
