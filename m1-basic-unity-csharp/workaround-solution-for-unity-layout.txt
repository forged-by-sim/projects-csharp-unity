Setting up my Unity layout. These are my workarounds:

- I went to the 3 vertical dots on the side of the open lock then clicked add tab.  

- I’ve clicked default. Then I’ve added tabs (or removed) at the appropriate locations.   

- I’ve maximized the project folder. It was set as a two column layout. I’ve changed to one column layout then minimized.  

-I also dragged a couple of tabs to their appropriate locations. Then saved my layout.
