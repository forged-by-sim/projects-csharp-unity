I tried to use the downloaded materials from the zip file for Windows but it didn’t work for me.  What I mean is that when I tried to open the program.cs from the Program Assignment 1 in Visual Studio, it was blank. 

So what I did instead was create my own project in the visual studio. Named it my way, not Program Assignment 1. Clicked console app then the program.cs appeared. I’ve copied the info of the program.cs from the Program Assignment 1 from Notepad and pasted it into my program.cs in Notepad. The saved changes appeared in the program.cs file in Visual Studio. Put Console.WriteLine(“element”) for each element. Save it. Build then build the solution. It was successful. Then ran the code. The terminal window popped up. Typed ‘1’ then enter. The list of the first 10 elements appeared.
